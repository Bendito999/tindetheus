# About the name
Tindetheus is a combination of Tinder (the popular online dating application) and the Greek Titans: [Prometheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus) and [Epimetheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(mythology)). Prometheus signifies "forethought," while  his brother Epimetheus denotes "afterthought". In synergy they serve to improve your Tinder experience.

Epimetheus creates a database from all of the profiles you review on Tinder. 

Prometheus learns from your historical preferences to automatically like new Tinder profiles.
